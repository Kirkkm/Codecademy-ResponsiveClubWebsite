            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Running for Brews | Friends, Sweat, & Beers</h3>
            <p>Running for Brews combines the love for fitness, brews, and social interaction through weekly running events, special social events, and fundraisers.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2010, Running for Brews started with just one location in Dunedin, FL. It all spilled over with a taste for delicious craft brews, love for fitness, and love for meeting new people. With over 25 locations across the US, RFB is now the largest social running club in the world! Relationships: By combining weekly runs, social events, themed runs, and charity events RFB has accomplished connecting new people locally. Each location meets on a weekly basis, runs a 5k-designated route, and then enjoys brews and great conversation with like-minded folks.</p>
            <p>Running for Brews continues to spread nationwide to bring like-minded people together in a fun, engaging, and new medium of socializing. We are actively searching for new Bars/Restaurants to work together and grow the community.

                “It is not all about the brews. The brews are just a bonus to building new relationships and creating a unique community of runners/walkers. Week in and week out, we have met thousands of individuals who have our same interests in mind.” - Co-Founders Kevin B. & John M.</p>
